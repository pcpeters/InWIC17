		<p>Our ability to offer an InWIC meeting annually is dependent on the support of our generous sponsors. The support we receive from sponsors helps us get the next group of young women excited about pursuing a career in computing. Silver, Gold, and Platinum sponsors receive complimentary registrations for one or more company representatives. These representatives may attend any and all of the conference, but most sponsors prefer to set up for interviews at different parts of the day.</p>
		<p>The Career Fair provides you with an opportunity to recruit for internships and/or jobs. We offer you the ability to collect resumes in advance and during the Fair. Additional advantages for sponsors include meeting many candidates face-to-face, variety of candidates from multiple schools, and "interviewing" in a relaxed, informal setting. We know skilled women in computing are in short supply, so another advantage lies in finding talented female computing majors in Indiana in one central location. In previous years attending students were enrolled at schools that include: Purdue University, Indiana University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis, DePauw University, and Butler University.</p>
